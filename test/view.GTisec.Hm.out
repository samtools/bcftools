# Genotype intersections across samples:
@SMPS NA00003 NA00002 NA00001
# The first line of each sample contains its count of missing genotypes, with a '-' appended
#   to the sample name.
# Human readable output (-H) was requested. Subset intersection counts are therefore sorted by
#   sample and repeated for each contained sample. For each sample, counts are in banker's 
#   sequence order regarding all other samples.
# [1] Number of shared non-ref genotypes 	[2] Samples sharing non-ref genotype (GT)
