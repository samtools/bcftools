Consensus sequence
------------------

Sometimes there is the need to create a consensus sequence for an individual
where the sequence incorporates variants typed for this individual.
This is possible using the ``consensus`` command.

We need the reference sequence ``reference.fa`` in the fasta format
and an indexed VCF with the variants ``calls.bcf``. The command is:

----
cat reference.fa | bcftools consensus calls.vcf.gz > consensus.fa
----

This assumes we have already made the calls. There is
link:variant-calling.html[another page] which goes deeper and is devoted just
to this, but in brief, the variant calling command in its simplest form is:

----
bcftools mpileup -Ou -f reference.fa alignments.bam | bcftools call -mv -Oz -o calls.vcf.gz
tabix calls.vcf.gz
----
