WARNING: **Do not use the program blindly, make an effort to understand what
strand convention your data uses! Make sure the reason for mismatching REF
alleles is not a different reference build!! Also do NOT use `bcftools norm --check-ref s` for this purpose,
as it will result in nonsense genotypes!!!**

This tool helps to determine and fix strand orientation.
Currently it can collect and print numbers useful in determining
the strand convention (the `stats` mode), swap REF/ALT alleles based on the 
SNP reference ID (the `id` mode), 
flip or swap non-ambiguous SNPs (the `flip` mode),
or convert from the 
link:http://www.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/technote_topbot.pdf[Illumina TOP strand]
convention to the forward strand (the `top` mode).

Run the stats to learn the number of REF allele mismatches and the number of 
non-biallelic sites:
----
bcftools +fixref test.bcf -- -f ref.fa
----

Another tool for checking the reference allele mismatches:
----
bcftools norm --check-ref e -f /path/to/reference.fasta input.vcf.gz -Ou -o /dev/null
----

If there are no REF mismatches and the number of multi-allelic sites is small, we are done.
If the output shows that the VCF is TOP-compatible, the following command can be
used to fix the strand:
----
bcftools +fixref test.bcf -Ob -o output.bcf -- -f ref.fa -m top
----


If the file contains dbSNP reference identificators (rsXXX in the ID column), the following
commands can be used to swap the reference and alternate alleles:
----
# Get the dbSNP annotation file. Make sure the correct reference build is used (e.g. b37)
#   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/docs/human_variation_vcf/
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606_b146_GRCh37p13/VCF/All_20151104.vcf.gz
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606_b146_GRCh37p13/VCF/All_20151104.vcf.gz.tbi

# Swap the alleles
bcftools +fixref broken.bcf -Ob -o fixref.bcf -- -d -f /path/to/reference.fasta -i All_20151104.vcf.gz

# The above command might have changed the coordinates, we must sort the VCF.
bcftools sort fixref.bcf -Ob -o fixref.sorted.bcf
----


In the most extreme case when nothing else is working, one can simply force
the unambiguous alleles onto the forward strand and drop the ambiguous genotypes.
----
bcftools +fixref test.bcf -Ob -o output.bcf -- -f ref.fa -m flip -d
----
**Note that this is an extremely unsafe operation and will most likely result in nonsense 
genotypes.** If you decide to use it anyway, make sure to **check the sanity of the
result** with the link:plugin.af-dist.html[af-dist plugin]!!
