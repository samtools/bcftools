=== About BCFtools

BCFtools is  a program for variant calling and manipulating files in the
Variant Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All commands work
transparently with both VCFs and BCFs, both uncompressed and BGZF-compressed.
In order to avoid tedious repetition, throughout this document we will use
"VCF" and "BCF" interchangeably, unless specifically noted.

Most commands accept VCF, bgzipped VCF and BCF with filetype detected
automatically even when streaming from a pipe. Indexed VCF and BCF
work in all situations. Unindexed VCF and BCF and streams
work in most, but not all situations. In general, whenever multiple VCFs are
read simultaneously, they must be indexed and therefore also compressed.
