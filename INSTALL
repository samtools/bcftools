System Requirements
===================

BCFtools and HTSlib depend on the zlib library <http://zlib.net>.  Building
them requires zlib development files to be installed on the build machine;
you may need to ensure a package such as zlib1g-dev (on Debian or Ubuntu Linux)
or zlib-devel (on RPM/yum-based distributions) is installed.


Compilation
===========

'cd' to the bcftools-1.x directory containing the package's source and type
'make' to compile BCFtools.

This BCFtools release contains a copy of HTSlib which will be used to build
BCFtools.  If you already have a system-installed HTSlib or another HTSlib
that you would prefer to build against, you can arrange this by overriding
$(HTSDIR) by typing 'make HTSDIR=/path/to/htslib-source' -- see the makefile
for details.


Installation
============

Type 'make install' to install the bcftools executable and associated scripts
and a manual page to /usr/local.

Type 'make prefix=/path/to/dir install' to install everything under your
choice of installation directory.  The install target also understands
DESTDIR and the other usual installation directory variables.

The bgzip and tabix utilities are provided by HTSlib.  If you have not also
installed HTSlib separately, you may wish to install these utilities by hand
by copying bcftools-1.x/htslib-1.x/{bgzip,tabix} to the same bin directory
to which you have installed bcftools et al.
