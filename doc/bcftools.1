.SH "NAME"
bcftools \- utilities for variant calling and manipulating VCFs and BCFs.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBbcftools\fP [\-\-version|\-\-version\-only] [\-\-help] [\fICOMMAND\fP] [\fIOPTIONS\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
BCFtools  is  a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the Variant
Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All commands work
transparently with both VCFs and BCFs, both uncompressed and BGZF\-compressed.
.sp
Most commands accept VCF, bgzipped VCF and BCF with filetype detected
automatically even when streaming from a pipe. Indexed VCF and BCF
will work in all situations. Un\-indexed VCF and BCF and streams will
work in most, but not all situations. In general, whenever multiple VCFs are
read simultaneously, they must be indexed and therefore also compressed.
(Note that files with non\-standard index names can be accessed as e.g.
"\f(CRbcftools view \-r X:2928329 file.vcf.gz##idx##non\-standard\-index\-name\fP".)
.sp
BCFtools is designed to work on a stream. It regards an input file "\-" as the
standard input (stdin) and outputs to the standard output (stdout). Several
commands can thus be  combined  with  Unix pipes.
.SS "VERSION"
.sp
This manual page was last updated \fB2024\-09\-12\fP and refers to bcftools git version \fB1.21\fP.
.SS "BCF1"
.sp
The obsolete BCF1 format output by versions of samtools <= 0.1.19 is \fBnot\fP
compatible with this version of bcftools. To read BCF1 files one can use
the view command from old versions of bcftools packaged with samtools
versions <= 0.1.19 to convert to VCF, which can then be read by
this version of bcftools.

.SS "VARIANT CALLING"
.sp
See \fIbcftools call\fP for variant calling from the output of the
\fIsamtools mpileup\fP command. In versions of samtools <= 0.1.19 calling was
done with \fIbcftools view\fP. Users are now required to choose between the old
samtools calling model (\fI\-c/\-\-consensus\-caller\fP) and the new multiallelic
calling model (\fI\-m/\-\-multiallelic\-caller\fP). The multiallelic calling model
is recommended for most tasks.

The following options are common to many bcftools commands. See usage for
specific commands to see if they apply.
.sp
\fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Files can be both VCF or BCF, uncompressed or BGZF\-compressed. The file "\-"
is interpreted as standard input. Some tools may require tabix\- or
CSI\-indexed files.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c, \-\-collapse\fP \fIsnps\fP|\fIindels\fP|\fIboth\fP|\fIall\fP|\fIsome\fP|\fInone\fP|\fIid\fP
.RS 4
Controls  how to treat records with duplicate positions and defines compatible
records across multiple input files. Here by "compatible" we mean records which
should be considered as identical by the tools. For example, when performing
line intersections, the desire may be to consider as identical all sites with
matching positions (\fBbcftools isec \-c\fP \fIall\fP), or only sites with  matching variant
type (\fBbcftools isec \-c\fP \fIsnps\fP\~ \fB\-c\fP \fIindels\fP), or only sites with all alleles
identical (\fBbcftools isec \-c\fP \fInone\fP).
.sp

.RE
.sp
\fIall\fP
.RS 4
all records are compatible, regardless of whether the ALT alleles
match or not. In the case of records with the same position, only
the first will be considered and appear on output.
.RE
.sp
\fIsnps\fP
.RS 4
any SNP records are compatible, regardless of whether the ALT
alleles match or not. For duplicate positions, only the first SNP
record will be considered and appear on output.
.RE

\fIindels\fP
.RS 4
all  indel records are compatible, regardless of whether the REF
and ALT alleles match or not. For duplicate positions, only the
first indel record will be considered and appear on output.

\fB\-f, \-\-apply\-filters\fP \fILIST\fP
.RS 4
Skip sites where FILTER column does not contain any of the strings listed
in \fILIST\fP. For example, to include only sites which have no filters set,
use \fB\-f\fP \fI.,PASS\fP.
.RE

.RS 4
Do not append version and command line information to the output VCF header.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o, \-\-output\fP \fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
When output consists of a single stream, write it to \fIFILE\fP rather than
to standard output, where it is written by default.
The file type is determined automatically from the file name suffix and in
case a conflicting \fB\-O\fP option is given, the file name suffix takes precedence.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-O, \-\-output\-type\fP \fIb\fP|\fIu\fP|\fIz\fP|\fIv\fP[0\-9]
.RS 4
Output compressed BCF (\fIb\fP), uncompressed BCF (\fIu\fP), compressed VCF (\fIz\fP), uncompressed VCF (\fIv\fP).
Use the \-Ou option when piping between bcftools subcommands to speed up
performance by removing unnecessary compression/decompression and
VCF\(<-\(->BCF conversion.
\~
The compression level of the compressed formats (\fIb\fP and \fIz\fP) can be set by
by appending a number between 0\-9.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r, \-\-regions\fP \fIchr\fP|\fIchr:pos\fP|\fIchr:beg\-end\fP|\fIchr:beg\-\fP[,...]
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of regions, see also \fB\-R, \-\-regions\-file\fP. Overlapping
records are matched even when the starting coordinate is outside of the
region, unlike the \fB\-t/\-T\fP options where only the POS coordinate is checked.
Note that \fB\-r\fP cannot be used in combination with \fB\-R\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-R, \-\-regions\-file\fP \fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Regions can be specified either on command line or in a VCF, BED, or
tab\-delimited file (the default). The columns of the tab\-delimited file
can contain either positions (two\-column format: CHROM, POS) or intervals
(three\-column format: CHROM, BEG, END), but not both. Positions are 1\-based
and inclusive. The columns of the tab\-delimited BED file are also
CHROM, POS and END (trailing columns are ignored), but coordinates
are 0\-based, half\-open.  To indicate that a file be treated as BED rather
than the 1\-based tab\-delimited file, the file must have the ".bed" or
".bed.gz" suffix (case\-insensitive). Uncompressed files are stored in
memory, while bgzip\-compressed and tabix\-indexed region files are streamed.
Note that sequence names must match exactly, "chr20" is not the same as
"20".  Also note that chromosome ordering in \fIFILE\fP will be respected,
the VCF will be processed in the order in which chromosomes first appear
in \fIFILE\fP. However, within chromosomes, the VCF will always be
processed in ascending genomic coordinate order no matter what order they
appear in \fIFILE\fP. Note that overlapping regions in \fIFILE\fP can result in
duplicated out of order positions in the output.
This option requires indexed VCF/BCF files. Note that \fB\-R\fP cannot be used
in combination with \fB\-r\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-regions\-overlap\fP \fIpos\fP|\fIrecord\fP|\fIvariant\fP|\fI0\fP|\fI1\fP|\fI2\fP
.RS 4
This option controls how overlapping records are determined:
set to \fBpos\fP or \fB0\fP if the VCF record has to have POS inside a region
(this corresponds to the default behavior of \fB\-t/\-T\fP);
set to \fBrecord\fP or \fB1\fP if also overlapping records with POS outside a region
should be included (this is the default behavior of \fB\-r/\-R\fP, and includes indels
with POS at the end of a region, which are technically outside the region); or set
to \fBvariant\fP or \fB2\fP to include only true overlapping variation (compare
the full VCF representation "\f(CRTA>T\-\fP" vs the true sequence variation "\f(CRA>\-\fP").
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s, \-\-samples\fP [^]\fILIST\fP
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of samples to include or exclude if prefixed
with "^." (Note that when multiple samples are to be excluded,
the "^" prefix is still present only once, e.g.  "^SAMPLE1,SAMPLE2".)
The sample order is updated to reflect that given on the command line.
Note that in general tags such as INFO/AC, INFO/AN, etc are not updated
to correspond to the subset samples. \fBbcftools view\fP is the
exception where some tags will be updated (unless the \fB\-I, \-\-no\-update\fP
option is used; see \fBbcftools view\fP documentation). To use updated
tags for the subset in another command one can pipe from \fBview\fP into
that command. For example:
.RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
    bcftools view \-Ou \-s sample1,sample2 file.vcf | bcftools query \-f %INFO/AC\(rst%INFO/AN\(rsn
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
\fB\-S, \-\-samples\-file\fP [^]\fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
File of sample names to include or exclude if prefixed with "^".
One sample per line. See also the note above for the \fB\-s, \-\-samples\fP
option.
The sample order is updated to reflect that given in the input file.
The command \fBbcftools call\fP accepts an optional second
column indicating ploidy (0, 1 or 2) or sex (as defined by
\fB\-\-ploidy\fP, for example "F" or "M"), for example:
.RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
    sample1    1
    sample2    2
    sample3    2

.sp
or

.nf
.fam C
    sample1    M
    sample2    F
    sample3    F
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If the second column is not present, the sex "F" is assumed.
With \fBbcftools call \-C\fP \fItrio\fP, PED file is expected.
The program ignores the first column and the last indicates sex (1=male, 2=female), for example:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
    ignored_column  daughterA fatherA  motherA  2
    ignored_column  sonB      fatherB  motherB  1

.if n .RE
.sp
\fB\-t, \-\-targets\fP [^]\fIchr\fP|\fIchr:pos\fP|\fIchr:from\-to\fP|\fIchr:from\-\fP[,...]
.RS 4
Similar as \fB\-r, \-\-regions\fP, but the next position is accessed by streaming the
whole VCF/BCF rather than using the tbi/csi index. Both \fB\-r\fP and \fB\-t\fP options
can be applied simultaneously: \fB\-r\fP  uses  the index  to  jump  to  a  region
and \fB\-t\fP discards positions which are not in the targets. Unlike \fB\-r\fP, targets
can be prefixed with "^" to request logical complement. For example, "^X,Y,MT"
indicates that sequences X, Y and MT should be skipped.
Yet another difference between the \fB\-t/\-T\fP and \fB\-r/\-R\fP is that \fB\-r/\-R\fP checks for
proper overlaps and considers both POS and the end position of an indel, while \fB\-t/\-T\fP
considers the POS coordinate only (by default; see also \fB\-\-regions\-overlap\fP and \fB\-\-targets\-overlap\fP).
Note that \fB\-t\fP cannot be used in combination with \fB\-T\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-T, \-\-targets\-file\fP [^]\fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Same \fB\-t, \-\-targets\fP, but reads regions from a file. Note that \fB\-T\fP
cannot be used in combination with \fB\-t\fP.
.sp
With the \fBcall \-C\fP \fIalleles\fP command, third column of the targets file must
be comma\-separated list of alleles, starting with the reference allele.
Note that the file must be compressed and indexed.
Such a file can be easily created from a VCF using:

\fB\-\-threads\fP \fIINT\fP
.RS 4

one of "tbi" or "csi" depending on output file format. Defaults to
CSI unless specified otherwise. Can be used only for compressed
BCF and VCF output.
.RE
.SS "bcftools annotate \fI[OPTIONS]\fP \fIFILE\fP"
.sp
Add or remove annotations.
.sp
\fB\-a, \-\-annotations\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
Bgzip\-compressed and tabix\-indexed file with annotations. The file
can be VCF, BED, or a tab\-delimited file with mandatory columns CHROM, POS
(or, alternatively, FROM and TO), optional columns REF and ALT, and arbitrary
number of annotation columns. BED files are expected to have
the ".bed" or ".bed.gz" suffix (case\-insensitive), otherwise a tab\-delimited file is assumed.
Note that in case of tab\-delimited file, the coordinates POS, FROM and TO are
one\-based and inclusive.  When REF and ALT are present, only matching VCF
records will be annotated. If the END coordinate is present in the annotation file
and given on command line as "\f(CR\-c ~INFO/END\fP", then VCF records will be matched also by the INFO/END coordinate.
If ID is present in the annotation file and given as "\f(CR\-c ~ID\fP", then VCF records will be matched
also by the ID column.
\~
.br
\~
.br
When multiple ALT alleles are present in the annotation file (given as
comma\-separated list of alleles), at least one must match one of the
alleles in the corresponding VCF record. Similarly, at least one
alternate allele from a multi\-allelic VCF record must be present in the
annotation file.
\~
.br
\~
.br
Missing values can be added by providing "." in place of actual value
and using the missing value modifier with \fB\-c\fP, such as ".TAG".
\~
.br
\~
.br
Note that flag types, such as "INFO/FLAG", can be annotated by including
a field with the value "1" to set the flag, "0" to remove it, or "." to
keep existing flags.

.sp
\fB\-c, \-\-columns\fP \fIlist\fP
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of columns or tags to carry over from the annotation file
(see also \fB\-a, \-\-annotations\fP). If the annotation file is not a VCF/BCF,
\fIlist\fP describes the columns of the annotation file and must include CHROM,
POS (or, alternatively, FROM,TO or BEG,END), and optionally REF and ALT. Unused
columns which should be ignored can be indicated by "\-".
\~
.br
\~
.br
If the annotation file is a VCF/BCF, only the edited columns/tags must be present and their
order does not matter. The columns ID, QUAL, FILTER, INFO and FORMAT
can be edited, where INFO tags can be written both as "INFO/TAG" or simply "TAG",
and FORMAT tags can be written as "FORMAT/TAG" or "FMT/TAG".
The imported VCF annotations can be renamed as "DST_TAG:=SRC_TAG" or "FMT/DST_TAG:=FMT/SRC_TAG".
\~
.br
\~
.br
To carry over all INFO annotations, use "INFO". To add all INFO annotations except
"TAG", use "^INFO/TAG". By default, existing values are replaced.
\~
.br
\~
.br
By default, existing tags are overwritten unless the source value is a missing value (i.e. ".").
If also missing values should be carried over (and overwrite existing tags), use ".TAG" instead of "TAG".
To add annotations without overwriting existing values (that is, to add tags that are absent or
to add values to existing tags with missing values), use "+TAG" instead of "TAG". These can be combined,
for example ".+TAG" can be used to add TAG even if the source value is missing but only if TAG does not
exist in the target file; existing tags will not be overwritten.
To append to existing values (rather than replacing or leaving untouched), use "=TAG"
(instead of "TAG" or "+TAG").
To replace only existing values without modifying missing annotations, use "\-TAG".
As a special case of this, if position needs to be replaced, mark the column with the new coordinate as "\-POS".

.sp
Haplotype aware consequence predictor which correctly handles combined
variants such as MNPs split over multiple VCF records, SNPs separated by
an intron (but adjacent in the spliced transcript) or nearby frame\-shifting
indels which in combination in fact are not frame\-shifting.
.sp
The output VCF is annotated with INFO/BCSQ and FORMAT/BCSQ tag (configurable
with the \fB\-c\fP option). The latter is a bitmask of indexes to INFO/BCSQ, with
interleaved haplotypes. See the usage examples below for using the %TBCSQ
converter in \fBquery\fP for extracting a more human readable form from this
bitmask. The construction of the bitmask limits the number of consequences
that can be referenced per sample in the FORMAT/BCSQ tags. By default this is 15, but
if more are required, see the \fB\-\-ncsq\fP option.
.sp
Note that the program annotates only records with a functional consequence and
intergenic regions will pass through unchanged.
.sp
The program requires on input a VCF/BCF file, the reference genome in fasta
format (\fB\-\-fasta\-ref\fP) and genomic features in the GFF3 format downloadable
from the Ensembl website (\fB\-\-gff\-annot\fP), and outputs an annotated VCF/BCF
file. Currently, only Ensembl GFF3 files are supported.
.sp
By default, the input VCF should be phased. If phase is unknown, or only
partially known, the \fB\-\-phase\fP option can be used to indicate how to handle
unphased data. Alternatively, haplotype aware calling can be turned off
with the \fB\-\-local\-csq\fP option.
.sp
If conflicting (overlapping) variants within one haplotype are detected,
a warning will be emitted and predictions will be based on only the first
variant in the analysis.
.sp
Symbolic alleles are not supported. They will remain unannotated in the
output VCF and are ignored for the prediction analysis.

Individuals are identified from the SM tags in the @RG header lines.  Multiple
individuals can be pooled in one alignment file, also one individual can be

Note that there are two orthogonal ways to specify locations in the
input file; via \fB\-r\fP \fIregion\fP and \fB\-t\fP \fIpositions\fP.  The
former uses (and requires) an index to do random access while the
latter streams through the file contents filtering out the specified
regions, requiring no index.  The two may be used in conjunction.  For
example a BED file containing locations of genes in chromosome 20
could be specified using \fB\-r 20 \-t chr20.bed\fP, meaning that the
index is used to find chromosome 20 and then it is filtered for the
regions listed in the BED file. Also note that the \fB\-r\fP option can be much

multiple regions and many alignment files are processed.

Indels have no impact on the mapping quality.

The intent of this option is to work around aligners that compute a
mapping quality using a local alignment without having any regard to
the degree of clipping required or consideration of potential
contamination or large scale insertions with respect to the reference.
A record may align uniquely and have no close second match, but having
a high number of mismatches may still imply that the reference is not
the correct site.

However we do not recommend use of this parameter unless you fully

Run the BAQ algorithm on all reads, not just those in problematic

By default mpileup uses heuristics to decide when to apply the BAQ
algorithm.  Most sequences will not be BAQ adjusted, giving a CPU
time closer to \-\-no\-BAQ, but it will still be applied in regions
with suspected problematic alignments.  This has been tested to
work well on single sample data with even allele frequency, but
the reliability is unknown for multi\-sample calling and for low

those scenarios.

.RE
.SS "Filter options:"
.sp
Note that filter options below dealing with counting the number of alleles
will, for speed, first check for the values of AC and AN in the INFO column to
avoid parsing all the genotype (FORMAT/GT) fields in the VCF. This means
that filters like \fI\-\-uncalled\fP, \-\-exclude\-uncalled\*(Aq, or \fI\-\-min\-af 0.1\fP will be calculated from INFO/AC and
INFO/AN when available or FORMAT/GT otherwise. However, it will not attempt to use any other existing field,
like INFO/AF for example. For that, use \fI\-\-exclude AF<0.1\fP instead.
.sp
Also note that one must be careful when sample subsetting and filtering is performed in a single command
because the order of internal operations can influence the result. For example, the \fB\-i/\-e\fP filtering
is performed before sample removal, but the \fB\-P\fP filtering is performed after,
and some are inherently ambiguous, for example allele counts can be taken from the INFO
column when present but calculated on the fly when absent. Therefore it is strongly recommended to spell out the
required order explicitly by separating such commands into two steps. (Make sure to use the \fB\-O u\fP option
when piping!)

Comma in strings is interpreted as a separator and when multiple values are compared, the OR logic is used.
Consequently, the following two expressions are equivalent but not the third:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
\-i \*(AqTAG="hello,world"\*(Aq
\-i \*(AqTAG="hello" || TAG="world"\*(Aq

Variables and function names are case\-insensitive, but not tag names. For example,
"qual" can be used instead of "QUAL", "strlen()" instead of "STRLEN()" , but
not "dp" instead of "DP".

\-i \*(AqTAG[*]=1\*(Aq   .. true, the record will be printed
\-i \*(AqTAG[*]!=1\*(Aq  .. true

\-e \*(AqTAG[*]!=1\*(Aq  .. false
\-i \*(AqTAG[0]=1\*(Aq   .. true
\-i \*(AqTAG[0]!=1\*(Aq  .. false

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.sp
HTSlib was designed with BCF format in mind. When parsing VCF files, all records
are internally converted into BCF representation. Simple operations, like removing
a single column from a VCF file, can be therefore done much faster with standard
UNIX commands, such as \fBawk\fP or \fBcut\fP.
Therefore it is recommended to use BCF as input/output format whenever possible to avoid
large overhead of the VCF \(-> BCF \(-> VCF conversion.
